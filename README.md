J R R Tolkien Drevo in list Book cover reproduction
![Cover](Reference/Upscaled.jpg)

J. R. R. Tolkien – Drevo in list was published by Mladinska Knjiga as part of the Odisej series. Since the original dust jacket (slipcover) often gets lost, I created an approximate reproduction to make my copy look complete again.

I printed it as a poster using an online printing service — the width of the cover should be set to 21 cm, and I used the 30 × 40 cm poster format.

All image editing was done with  [Pixlr Editor](https://pixlr.com/editor/) 
, where you can also open the accompanying .pxz files.

If you’d like to create a more faithful reproduction, the back cover could be refined further, and the flaps should include the author’s bio. I managed to get hold of another book from the Odisej series only after sending my version to print, so those details will have to stay on the to-do list for now.
